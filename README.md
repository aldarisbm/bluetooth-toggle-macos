### Why?

- I use my bluetooth headphones with different laptops and for some weird reason, the bluetooth stays "on" even after disconnecting the power source from laptop a,
making it harder to pair to a different device. 
- This script attempts to turn off the bluetooth everytime the power is not connected AND the lid is closed.
