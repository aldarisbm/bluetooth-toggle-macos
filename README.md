## Why?

I use my laptop on clamshell state (lid closed) 90% of the time. I usually flip between two MacBooks (work & personal), and one thing that drove me crazy is that
even when my laptop is not connected to power and in clamshell state, essentially "off", bluetooth devices stay connected to it.
